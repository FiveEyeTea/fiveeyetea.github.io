      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m Jacob, a lifelong writer turned cybersecurity professional (entry-level). Following several attempted careers, I’ve embarked on a journey of education in Information Technology with the goal of entering the Information Security industry. I aim to leverage my talents and my passion for technology in order to find a lifetime career. I am obsessed with learning new things; I’m the sort who will geek out over the cultivation of tea, the history of the blue LED, minute differences between Linux distros and the quirks of DOS viruses. I started this site to document my progress in learning IT/security topics, and to showcase any projects or discuss opinions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
